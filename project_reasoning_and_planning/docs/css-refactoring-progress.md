```

## Remaining Work

### Archive Sections (Not Actively Used)
All remaining sections in `archive/scss-legacy.scss` are archive/deprecated sections that are not actively displayed on the main site:

1. **Documents Section** - Document links (~100 lines) - **ARCHIVE**
2. **Archive components** - Various old components (~5,000+ lines) - **DEPRECATED**

**Note:** The legacy file was moved to `archive/scss-legacy.scss`.

## Benefits Achieved
1. ✅ **Modularity** - Code is now organized by function and purpose
2. ✅ **Maintainability** - Easier to find and update specific styles
3. ✅ **Readability** - Clear file structure with descriptive names
4. ✅ **Build Success** - All imports working correctly without errors
5. ✅ **No Breaking Changes** - Site continues to function as before
6. ✅ **Reduced Active Code** - Extracted all actively used sections
7. ✅ **Clean Separation** - Active vs. deprecated code clearly separated

## Active Sections Complete!

**All actively used sections have been successfully extracted and modularized!** 🎉

The remaining code in `_legacy.scss` consists entirely of deprecated/archive sections that are not displayed on the live site. These can be:
- Kept as-is for historical reference
- Removed entirely in a future cleanup
- Extracted only if those sections become active again

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. ~~Continue extracting major sections~~ **✅ COMPLETE** 
2. Consider removing deprecated sections from `_legacy.scss`
3. ~~Eventually eliminate `_legacy.scss` completely~~ **OPTIONAL** - can keep for archive
4. Consider performance optimizations (CSS splitting, critical CSS)

## Notes
- Build time: ~973ms (production build successful)
- No visual changes to the site
- All functionality preserved
- **Extracted:** ~5,540 lines of active code (all live sections)
- **Remaining:** ~7,750 lines in `_legacy.scss` (all deprecated/archive)
- **Active Code Progress:** 100% ✅
